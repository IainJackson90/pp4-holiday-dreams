## Database diagram

This is a diagram of the models it has been altered during development and not all models were implemented and others where created instead to create a more user friendly experience.
The recommendation model was removed and instead some of the fields was incorporated into the post field it made more sense to me at the time to do it this way after with full user UX in mind.
I have added a Like model after to create a user interaction with a post.

## Color pallet of the App
I created the Webb App with the mindset of creating a relaxing ambiance by using natural neutral colors that give you a feeling of having a holiday ith good weather and gets you not too overwhelmed and hopefully gets the user to blog or read some post.
I used three colors in this web App and tried sticking to the 60, 30, 10 rule of using colors.

- Ten percent more or less of the color #34A426
- Ten thirty more or less of the color #48817A
- Ten sixty more or less of the color #3C8CA7
